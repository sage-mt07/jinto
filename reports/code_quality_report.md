# Code Quality Report for tests Directory

During the review of the `tests` directory as **鏡花**, it was found that several C# test files lacked a trailing newline at the end of file. This can cause issues with certain tools and violate common style guidelines.

All affected test files have been updated to include a trailing newline.
